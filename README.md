# Fingerprint Recognition

• Fingerprint Recognition in runtime using images captured from mobile.

• Feature extraction using Gabor filter, redge orientation and SIFT. Feature matching using SIFT and RANSAC.

• This project is built using Java, Android and OpenCV. Also built in MATLAB.

• The project is done as a part of coursework for 'Advanced Computer Vision' subject, MSc Artificial Intelligence, University of Southampton.

• Video Demo:
